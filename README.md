- 👋 Hi, I’m @MMJLee or Matthew.  My background is in mechanical engineering with a math minor, but I've taken many cs classes along the way. I'm currently working as a project manager, but I would like to pivot my career towards software development. 
- 👀 I’m interested in a career in backend or fullstack development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning full stack development using Spring, PostgreSQL, and Vue.js.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything and everything!
- 📫 You can reach me at MatthewMJLee@Gmail.com
